        "Hypothesis testing is a procedure for testing a claim or hypothesis about a parameter in a population, using data measured in a sample.\n",
        "2. > What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
        "- The null hypothesis (H₀) is a statement that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables. It represents the status quo or a baseline assumption that you test against.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Purpose: To provide a benchmark for testing whether an observed effect is statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Assumed to be true until evidence suggests otherwise.\n",
        "- The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents what you want to prove — that there is an effect, difference, or relationship.\n",
        "3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
        "- The significance level, denoted by α (alpha), is the threshold probability you set before conducting a hypothesis test to decide how strong the evidence must be to reject the null hypothesis (H₀).\n",

        "\n",
        "- 3 . Balances Sensitivity and Specificity\n",
